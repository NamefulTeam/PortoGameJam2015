---------- GLIDING GLITCH TUTORIAL -----------

--- DESCRIPTION ---

You are in the command of the Gliders (infamous computer virus) and your purpose is to cause a glitch in every computer system you can find.

However, every system has its Watchers (anti-virus) who will kill your Gliders and heal the damage caused. 
They are only destroyed by Glider's explosions (which is caused when two collide). 
Moreover, when a Watcher dies, a new Glider is created. This may cause chain explosions.

The goal of the game is to corrupt each system, by eliminating all the Watchers.
When you have successfully cause glitches in every level, you win the game.

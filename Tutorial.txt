---------- GLIDING GLITCH TUTORIAL -----------

--- DESCRIPTION ---

You are in the command of the Gliders (infamous computer virus) and your purpose is to cause a glitch in every computer system you can find.

However, every system has its Watchers (anti-virus) who will kill your Gliders and heal the damage caused. 
They are only destroyed by Glider explosions (which are caused when two collide). 
Moreover, when a Watcher dies, a new Glider is created. This may cause chain explosions.

The goal of the game is to corrupt every system, by eliminating all the Watchers.
When you have successfully caused glitches in every level, you win the game.

--- MECHANICS / HOW TO PLAY ---

When a level starts, you have a maximum number of Gliders you can place and you may do so only in certain locations (white squares).
You can delete your previously placed Gliders and insert them in a new slot.
Furthermore, you can also rotate them, in order to determine in which direction they will go.

To place a Glider click the desired position with the left mouse button.
To delete a already placed Glider, right click on it.
To rotate just left click on an existing Glider.

You can not move, delete or rotate Gliders outside white squares.

Once you are satisfied with how the board looks, just press Submit and enjoy!
You can always retry the level whenever you want or return to the main menu.
